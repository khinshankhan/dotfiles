Activates clean auto indent for function 'newline-and-indent' and
back-space unindent for M-DEL (meta-backspace).

clean-aindent mode is a global minor mode.

1. Extension of 'newline-and-indent' that keeps track of the last
auto-indent operation and, if it is abandoned, would take care to
trim down the unused white space characters.

2. Simple indent, if activated, where cursor is aligned with
indent of the lines above.

3. Backspace Unindent. Extension of M-backspace. When cursor is
in the indentation space of a line, or at the first character and
you press M-backspace it will move the entire line to be aligned
to the line above or any other that is with indentation smaller
than the current.
