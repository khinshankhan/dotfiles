# bash
All files pertaining to bash prompt.
## .bashrc
Aliases, functions, and scripts for bash to make usage easier and faster. Comments for complex code provided and reasons why code my be commented out. If device doesn't have certain programs pertaining to commands, the code won't break unless you try running a commend that has such an issue, but it is highly suggested you look into the application and see maybe if it's worth downloading. Note: Most functions have variables preset relating to `kkhan01` and this repo, `scripts`, one should change those to be more personal (eg `http` can clone your personal site by default instead) to use this more effectively.
