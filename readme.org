#+STARTIP: overview

* Mini Prelude
You should also check [[https://github.com/kkhan01/.myscripts][this]] out for some of my custom scripts I use everyday.
* Installing
There are two install (you'll have to manually install the programs,
 this only hosts my configs) methods, made for users' ease.
** Install everything with symlinks
#BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/kkhan01/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./install
#END_SRC
** Install specific programs with symlinks
(let PROGRAM be the placeholder you replace, eg to install emacs you
would replace PROGRAM with emacs in the following block)
** Install specific programs without symlinks
* How you can contribute
Feel free to fork and make a pull request. I check github quite often,
so I'll reply if I want any clarification, and accept/ reject (rejections
will receive a justified reason as to why they were rejected).
