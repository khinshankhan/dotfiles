;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; === Description of the features
;; 1. Extension of 'newline-and-indent' that keeps track of the last
;; auto-indent operation and, if it is abandoned, would take care to
;; trim down the unused white space characters.
;;
;; 2. Simple indent, if activated, where cursor is aligned with
;; indent of the lines above.
;;
;; 3. Backspace Unindent. Extension of M-backspace.
;; When cursor is in the indentation space of a line, or at the first
;; character and you press M-backspace it will move the entire line to
;; be aligned to the line above or any other that is with indentation
;; smaller than the current.
;;
;; Detailed documentation with example situations and screenshots:
;; http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CleanAutoIndent
;;
;; === To activate
;; 'M-x clean-aindent-mode'
;; or
;; add this to your init.el:
;; (clean-aindent-mode t)
;;
;; By default auto-indent is bound to 'C-j'. Bind it to 'RET' for most
;; convenient use of the features. Add this to your init.el:
;; (define-key global-map (kbd "RET") 'newline-and-indent)
;;
;; In case you installed the extension via MELPA, use this suggested configiration:
;;
;;  (defun my-pkg-init()
;;    (electric-indent-mode -1)  ; no electric indent, auto-indent is sufficient
;;    (clean-aindent-mode t)
;;    (setq clean-aindent-is-simple-indent t)
;;    (define-key global-map (kbd "RET") 'newline-and-indent))
;;  (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'my-pkg-init)
;;
;; === Options
;; M-x customize, search for 'auto indent', toggle to on,
;; then 'Apply and Save'.
;; or
;; add this to your init.el:
;; (set 'clean-aindent-is-simple-indent t)
;;

;;; Change Log:

;;     - Implement as an advice to 'newline-and-indent'
;;
;; 2014-06-01, pmarinov, v1.3.0

;;     - Further cleanup of the name space
;;
;; 2014-05-27, pmarinov, v1.2.0
;;     Changed: Move all function under the same namespace (function prefix)
;;
;; 2014-03-07, pmarinov, v1.1.0
;;     Added: Simple auto indent feature. Configurable via M-x customize.
;;
;; 2013-08-31, pmarinov, v1.0.0
;;     First implementation.
