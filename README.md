# scripts
A repository of useful shell scripts. Note this README should be updated as new scripts or changes in code are commited,and there should be a general description of each file. If the file has multiple parts to it (eg a `.bashrc`), each "aspect" should be commented with a description of its purpose.


## Descriptions

### quick.sh
Sometimes you have to clone, remove, and reclone a repository. You can easily do so with this script. Simply follow the comments in the file and you're set!
