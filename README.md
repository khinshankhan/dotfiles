# scripts
A repository of useful shell scripts. Note this README should be updated as new scripts or changes in code are commited,and there should be a general description of each file. If the file has multiple parts to it (eg a `.bashrc`), each "aspect" should be commented with a description of its purpose (can skip overly basic things like an alias that only `cd`s into a directory).


## Descriptions (please maintain alpgabetical)

### .bashrc
Aliases, functions, and scripts for bash to make usage easier and faster. Comments for complex code provided and reasons why code my be commented out. If device doesn't have certain programs pertaining to commands, the code won't break unless you try running a commend that has such an issue, but it is highly suggested you look into the application and see maybe if it's worth downloading. Note: Most functions have variables preset relating to `kkhan01` and this repo, `scripts`, one should change those to be more personal (eg `http` can clone your personal site by default instead) to use this more effectively. 

### quick.sh
Sometimes you have to clone, remove, and reclone a repository. You can easily do so with this script. Simply follow the comments in the file and you're set!
