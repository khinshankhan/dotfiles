# scripts
A repository of scripts and dotfiles. Note this README should include a list of all folders(try to keep it alphabetical!) with general description of the folder and then a list of files in that folder, along with a short description of those files. Inside each folder should be another README which will have the list of all files and that folder and the description of the files (essentially the sublist from this README pertaining to the folder).

ALL README FILES ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING CONVERTED TO ORG FILES.


## Descriptions (please maintain alphabetical)

### bash
All files pertaining to bash prompt.
#### .bashrc
Aliases, functions, and scripts for bash to make usage easier and faster. Comments for complex code provided and reasons why code my be commented out. If device doesn't have certain programs pertaining to commands, the code won't break unless you try running a commend that has such an issue, but it is highly suggested you look into the application and see maybe if it's worth downloading. Note: Most functions have variables preset relating to `kkhan01` and this repo, `scripts`, one should change those to be more personal (eg `http` can clone your personal site by default instead) to use this more effectively. 
 
### shell_scripts
Shell scripts that don't really have category to fit into it.
#### quick.sh
Sometimes you have to clone, remove, and reclone a repository. You can easily do so with this script. Simply follow the comments in the file and you're set!
